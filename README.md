# ConnectSphere

CloudAphere is a work-in-progress SaaS project that helps businesses **analyze and prioritize their own leads** so sales teams can focus on the most valuable prospects instead of wasting time on low-quality data.

The platform does **not generate or scrape leads**.  
Users bring their own data (such as CSV exports or CRM data), and CloudAphere applies rule-based logic and analytics to score leads, suggest follow-up priority, and present clear dashboards.

This project is being built **step by step as a learning-first, real-world SaaS application**, with a strong focus on backend fundamentals, business logic, and clean system design.

### Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (REST APIs)
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js will be introduced later for production features)
- **Data:** Database for storing leads and analytics (planned)
- **Auth:** JWT-based authentication (planned)

The main goal of this project is to build a **resume-ready and interview-ready SaaS codebase** while strengthening fundamentals in Node.js, React, API design, and overall system thinking.

🚧 Project is under active development.
